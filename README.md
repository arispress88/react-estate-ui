## Introduction

This project was created from forking the repository found in the description of Lama Dev's video called [React Real Estate App UI Design Tutorial for Beginners](https://youtu.be/HFj5FMb0jwY?si=KTMYX92I8Nbg5tV9). For me, this was an opportunity to practice creating a website with a positive UI experience for the end user as well as better understand how to make an app responsive to different window sizes, or to be view on a mobile device without losing the intergrity of the page.

## Features

- Responsive UI when adjusting the size of the page.
- Use of various containers to increase readability.
- Use of an open source map to show locations on a map.
